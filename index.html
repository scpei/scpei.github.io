                <p>
                    I am now a Research Associate at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">King Abdullah Univeristy of Science and Technology</a> since Jan. 2022, working with Prof. <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/">Xiangliang Zhang (Univeristy of Notre Dame)</a>. I received my Ph.D. at KAUST. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in computer science at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a> from Jan. 2018 to Dec. 2021. I was a member of the <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/mine">Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering (MINE)</a> Lab in the <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cbrc">Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC)</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/ZhangX.aspx">Xiangliang Zhang</a>. I received my M.S. degree in computer science from KAUST in December 2017. Before that, I obtained B.Eng. in software engineering from <a href="http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/">Xi'an Jiaotong University</a> in China in July 2016, where my research began under the supervision of Prof. Chao Shen. 
                    <!-- in the Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOE KLINNS Lab).-->
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research interests broadly lie in data mining and machine learning, in particular graph representation learning, knowledge representation learning and reasoning, knowledge acquisition and integration, recommendation system, weakly supervised learning, etc.
